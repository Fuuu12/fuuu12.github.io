Having spent more than seven years at Beijing Institute of Technology, I’ve only just begun building a GitHub homepage—something I should have done long ago. During my undergraduate years, simply keeping up with coursework felt overwhelming enough. After narrowly missing the mark on the postgraduate entrance exam, I didn’t continue in the Computer Science department as planned. Instead, I found myself in a well-regarded lab known for its relaxed, hands-off environment. That laid-back chapter lasted through the end of the pandemic, after which I worked on a few collaborative projects.

Eventually, and somewhat reluctantly, I decided to apply for a PhD. The path wasn’t smooth, but I persevered and was ultimately accepted. Over the past year, although I’ve felt far behind my peers, I’ve managed to produce some modest results through steady effort. This progress has inspired me to start documenting my research journey here.

I’d love to connect—feel free to reach out and exchange ideas!
